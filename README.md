### Containerized Architectures for Deep Learning ###

2019-- 14–17 October, London, UK

Container and cloud-native technologies around Kubernetes have become the de-facto standard in modern ML/AI application development. In this session, we’ll discuss common architecture blueprints and popular technologies used to integrate AI into your existing infrastructures, and how you can build a production-ready containerized platform for deep learning.

Speaker: Antje Barth


## 2019 ##

## [Advanced Spark and TensorFlow Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Advanced-Spark-and-TensorFlow-Meetup/) @ O'Reilly AI Conference NYC

### Slack After Dark ###

2019-- April 15, New York City, USA

Realtime ML + Kubernetes + TensorFlow + MLflow + Slack API + PipelineAI

Welcome to “Slack after Dark” - our slack-based dating app which showcases an end-to-end containerized & integrated ML workflow, running Online Model Predictions and Online Model Training using Keras/Tensorflow, PipelineAI, MapR Data Platform and Slack!

In this talk and live presentation you’ll also see how a streaming architecture can help you with moving from batch to real-time model training, and simplifying your overall model data logistics.

Speaker: Antje Barth (MapR)


## [Data Festival](https://www.datafestival.de/en/) ## 

### How to build a Containerized Architecture for Deep Learning ###

2019-- March 20, Munich, Germany

When it comes to AI data scientists/engineers tend to focus on tools. Though the data platform that enables these tools is equally important, it’s often overlooked. In fact, 90% of the effort required for success in ML is not the algorithm – it’s the data logistics. In this workshop we will talk about common architecture blueprints to integrate AI in your data centers and how the right data platform choice can make all the difference in launching your AI use case into production!

Speaker: Antje Barth (MapR), Ernst Kratky (Cisco)

## 2018 ##

## [Women in Big Data Duesseldorf Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Women-in-Big-Data-Dusseldorf/)

### Data in Action! ###

2018-- November 29, Duesseldorf, Germany

What happens if you put all the industry’s buzz words together?
You might end up in a Smart Drone demo that implements a micro-services approach to realtime, distributed image processing! :-) 

Learn and experience live how all those technical concepts work together in a fun demo, implementing a real-life use case.
